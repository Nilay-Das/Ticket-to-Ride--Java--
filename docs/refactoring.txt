Refactorings:
=============

1. File: Link.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): Line 13 - Line 18
   Issue Identified: Instance variables were public.
   Description of fix: Made the instance variables protected.
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

2. File: RouteCost.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): main()
   Issue Identified: Too much code in the main method for taking input and output.
   Description of fix: Moved the code for taking input and output into three separate methods: firstInput(), secondInput(), output().
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

3. File: RouteCost.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): firstInput(), secondInput() 
   Issue Identified: The for loop used for taking input is complicated to understand and is vulnerable to errors.
   Description of fix: Used while loop to take inputs, each input value is stored in individual variables. The code is cleaner now and much easier to understand how each input is being taken.
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

4. File: City.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): makeTree()
   Issue Identified: Too much code in just one method and the code is also a bit complicated to understand.
   Description of fix: Code should be moved into separate methods based on its functionality and there should be more documentation/comments to explain how the code is really working.
   Implemented: No
